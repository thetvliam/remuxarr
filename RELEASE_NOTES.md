# Release Notes

<!--
WHAT THIS FILE IS
=================
The pending release notes: what has changed since the last merge to main
that a USER would notice. Remuxarr serves it at /api/release-notes/ and the
UI shows it once, as a dialog, the first time someone loads the app after
the content changes.

It is not a changelog. A changelog accumulates; this file is emptied at the
start of each cycle, and only ever holds what is new since the last release.
Git history is the permanent record.

WHAT GOES IN IT
===============
One line per change a user could notice without reading the source. Written
for someone who runs the container, not for whoever reviewed the diff.

  Yes  a setting changed name, moved, or now defaults differently
  Yes  behaviour changed in a way that alters what ends up in their library
  Yes  a file naming convention changed
  Yes  something they reported is fixed
  Yes  an upgrade will silently reset or migrate part of their config

  No   refactors, renames, type hints, dead code removal
  No   test coverage, mutation testing, CI, lint
  No   internal fixes with no user-visible symptom
  No   anything whose honest description is "you would never know"

If a change needs the user to DO something, or will surprise them on
upgrade, say so plainly and say what to do. That is the whole reason this
is a dialog and not a file nobody opens.

FORMAT
======
`## Heading` starts a section, `- item` is an entry. Headings are free text
— use whatever describes the batch, e.g. Changed / Fixed / Added, or
something more specific. Everything above the first `##` is ignored, which
is why this comment is safe here. Keep entries to a sentence or two;
anything longer belongs in the docs, with a pointer from here.

THE CYCLE
=========
1. Work lands on `testing`. Whoever makes a user-visible change adds a line
   here in the same commit.
2. `testing` merges to `main` WITH those entries intact. Users pull main,
   the content hash changes, and the dialog shows once.
3. ONLY THEN are the released entries removed, on `testing`, in the same
   commit that adds the first entry of the next cycle. A cycle with nothing
   user-visible to add leaves the released entries in place until one
   arrives; main still holds them, so nothing is shown twice.

Step 3 is after step 2 and not part of it. Emptying the file in the merge
itself ships an empty file to main, and the release nobody was told about
is the one that renamed their settings. main keeps the last released set
until the next merge replaces it.

An empty file — no `##` sections — means no dialog. That is the correct
state for a cycle in which nothing user-visible has changed yet.

## Fixed

- The Job Timeout setting now also applies to files whose only work is extracting subtitles to SRT. A hung extraction there used to hold its worker slot until you pressed Abort or restarted the container; it now fails at the timeout like any other FFmpeg run.
- Sonarr and Radarr are now told about a processed file in two cases that used to miss them: when a library scan had already queued the file before the import webhook arrived, and when a file that needed nothing on import was processed later (after a settings change, for example). Before, those jobs finished without asking the service to rescan, so if Remuxarr changed the file's container (.mkv to .mp4, say), Sonarr or Radarr was left holding the old file name.
- If Sonarr or Radarr upgrades, renames or deletes a file while Remuxarr is processing it, the job now stops without writing anything, shows as cancelled (not failed, and not counted towards failure emails), and whatever is at that path is checked again. Before, the job reported success after overwriting the upgrade (or deleting it, during an MKV-to-MP4 conversion), writing a deleted file back, or leaving a renamed file under both names.
